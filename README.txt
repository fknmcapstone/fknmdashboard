FKNM Dashboard Website

This site details the research done by the Feeding Kids, Nourishing Minds team at the Joannah and Brian Lawson 
Centre for Child Nutrition at the University of Toronto. 

There are three areas of research conducted, separated into three Tracks. This is the basis of the website framework. 

The main components are: 
	- embeddings of Power BI files, representing the quantitative research results
	- mappings, to geographically indicate the scope of research
	- qualitative conclusions derived from the research analysis
